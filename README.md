Takeoff Labs Take Home Exercise

This is a frontend exercise that will give you the chance to see what kind of things we build at Takeoff Labs!

You will be building a simplified version of a dating app, very similar to Tinder. The app will display users a list of 'cards' that they can swipe left or right on, indicating interest or disinterest. 

Your job is set up an Swift iOS project that users a provided data set to render a card interface. I've provided the design and an explanation of each component in a Figma file - https://www.figma.com/file/tSBNcUTUkyMdgjrsMcDO2H/Swiping-Takehome?node-id=0%3A1. This file is included in the repository:

Ideally, this should take around a day to finish, but let us know how much time you spent so we can calibrate our expectations!


## Getting started

Run the following commands:

```
cd swiping-ios-akehome/
open takehome.xcworkspace
```

This should open an empty Swift project. Please implement the requested UI in the provided UIViewController at 'ViewController.m'.
